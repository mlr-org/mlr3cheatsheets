## Instructions

(For internal use only)

Please do not upload `.pdf`-versions, only LaTeX and image files.

A functional LaTeX installation is required.
Alternatively, install the {tinytex} package and call `tinytex::latexmk()` on the respective `.tex` file of the cheatsheet.
{tinytex} will auto-install all missing packages and render the cheatsheet afterwards.
